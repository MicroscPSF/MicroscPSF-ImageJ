This is a preliminary project implementing the fast microscopic PSF generation tool.

It is intended as a starting point to develop a comprehensive ImageJ plugin for the PSF generation. The core codes have been finished. A nice GUI is needed for better interactions. You are encouraged to be involved in this project.
