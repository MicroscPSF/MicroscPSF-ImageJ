This is an Eclipse project of the ImageJ plugin for implementing the fast microscopic PSF (specifically, the Gibson-Lanni model) generation tool. Technical details can be found at [here](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~jzli/MicroscPSF/). [The plugin](target/MicroscPSF_IJ-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar) itself can be downloaded from the `target` folder.

It is intended as a starting point to develop a comprehensive ImageJ plugin for the PSF generation. The core codes have been finished. A nice GUI is needed for better interactions. You are encouraged to be involved in this project.
